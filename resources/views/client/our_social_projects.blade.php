                        <p>Ever since the foundation of our agency, our number-one objective has been, and still is,
                            connecting the people of Atlas and Sahara with travellers from all corners of the world and
                            making sure that both benefit from the cultural encounter.</p>
                        <p>Our travellers discover beautiful places and the local inhabitants show great hospitality in
                            receiving them in their own homes. The travellers immerse themselves in a completely
                            different
                            culture that carries them, baffles them, and surely changes their perception of the world,
                            of
                            the other, of Amazighs. Not only that, but children and adults in the remote villages of
                            Atlas
                            gradually learn to see the <strong><em>“Roumi”</em></strong> as a friend, as a member of the
                            tribe and no longer as the tourist from whom they receive few pennies. Strong bonds are
                            being
                            forged; the cultural exchange is authentic and profound. We constantly experience this
                            miracle,
                            and that gives us immense pleasure. Thanks to the enormous power of such an encounter and
                            the
                            positive impact it has on people, our agency has been involved for many years in social
                            development and environmental conservation programs in partnerships with several
                            associations in
                            the Atlas mountains, Essaouira region and in southern Morocco:</p>

                            for the children of the village all summer long. Last but not least, a medical team came to
